# UDP Ping Client and Server

## Overview

This project includes a UDP-based Ping client and server. The client sends ping messages to the server, and the server responds to the client. The client measures the Round-Trip Time (RTT) for each response and handles packet loss.

## Instructions

### Running the Server (server.py)

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing ```server.py```.

3. Run the server code:

   ```bash
   python server.py
### Running the Client (client.py)

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing ```clent.py```.

3. Run the server code:

   ```bash
   python server.py

### Dependencies

The client and server programs do not have any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library.

### Troubleshooting

1. Check that the server is running before running the client.

2. Verify that Python is correctly installed on your system.

3. Ensure that both the client and server are running on the same network or machine for initial testing (localhost).
