Concurrent Client-Server Application README
Overview
This README provides information about the concurrent server configuration and the libraries used in the Concurrent Client-Server Application.

Concurrent Server Configuration
The server component of this application has been designed to handle multiple client connections concurrently. This concurrent server configuration is achieved using Python's threading module. Each incoming client connection is processed in its own thread, allowing the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously.

Library Used
The threading module is a built-in Python library that provides a high-level interface for creating and managing threads. It is used in this application to achieve concurrency. Threads are lightweight and can run concurrently, making them well-suited for handling multiple client connections without blocking other clients.
